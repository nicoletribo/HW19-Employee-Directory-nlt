# HW19-Employee-Directory-nlt

## Description

For this assignment, we created an employee directory with React. This assignment required us to break up our application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. When the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.
